      <b>Why Is Exercise Important during Menopause?</b>
      <p>Many women gain weight after menopause. This may be because of declining estrogen levels. Raising your activity level will help avoid this weight gain. Regular exercise benefits the heart and bones, helps control weight, and can improve your mood.Exercise in menopause can help maintain bone density, preserve muscle mass, and reduce the risk of chronic disease. Unfortunately, the natural decline in estrogen levels during menopause means that the body is more susceptible to bone fractures, muscle loss, and weight gain.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="exer1">
      <b>What Exercises To Do During Menopause?</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Cardio:</b><br>Aerobic activity that makes use of your large muscle groups while keeping up your heart rate is a good thing. Your options for cardio are limitless. Almost any activity counts, for example:<br>1)Walking<br>2)Jogging<br>3)Biking
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Yoga:</b><br>Yoga for menopause is all about staying cool, calm, and collected. You want to keep your nervous system balanced and use the practice to maintain strength without overheating the body.

    <b class="sym-symbols">The following five yoga poses are my favorite ways to meet menopause with grace and acceptance:</b><br><br>

    <div class="ex2">
      <h8>CAT/COW POSE</h8>
    <p>The combination of these two poses moves your spine through a range of motion, affecting both the front and back of the spine. <br>
    When you open the chest in the cow position, you stretch the part of the body that relates to your sympathetic nervous system (what produces the fight-or-flight response). <br>When you round the back in the cat position, you stretch the part of the body that relates to the parasympathetic nervous system (the relaxed part of your nervous system).<br>
    During menopause, your joints start to dry out.
    By fluidly moving between these two positions, you massage the joints and tissues around the spine, keeping them soft, supple, and young.</p>

    <div class="ex2">
      <h8>LUNGE POSE</h8>
    <p>
      The lunge pose stretches the hip flexors and the psoas muscles. 
  The psoas muscles connect the lower back to the upper thighs. <br>The psoas can get tight if you spend a lot of your day seated.<br> It also constricts when you get stressed. Menopause and its shifting symptoms can cause shallow breathing. 
  Stretching the psoas frees up your breath and releases pent-up tension.

    <div class="ex2">
      <h8>FAN POSTURE</h8>
    <p>
The fan posture has many benefits. As you get older, your muscles shorten and tighten. <br>The two muscle groups that are most affected are the hamstrings and inner thighs. Fan posture targets them both. Stretching is one way to directly affect the nervous system.<br>
 When the head is lower than the heart, receptors are triggered that lower blood pressure, heart rate, and mental activity. <br>This is a safe and cooling variation to other inversions like handstand or headstand.

    <div class="ex2">
      <h8>SPHINX POSE</h8>
    <p>
      Chest-opening postures stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and counteract sluggishness and depression.<br>
 Stimulating poses like sphinx are both energizing and rejuvenating. <br>Sphinx pose is an easy alternative to more challenging backbends.

    <h8>FORWARD FACE HERO POSE</h8>
    <p>
      It stretches the inner thighs, stimulates the front of the thighs, stretches the spine, and, because the head is lower than the heart, calms and cools the nervous system. <br>It also directly rejuvenates the pelvic region. If your thighs are tight or you have knee problems, make sure to place a rolled-up blanket behind your knees.

    <p>Exercise shouldn't be entirely hard work. Packing a calorie-burning cardio session into your routine can be fun and good for your body.<br>If running on a treadmill isn't your thing, consider a dance class. Dance can help to build muscle and keep you flexible. Look for a style that suits you:</p>
